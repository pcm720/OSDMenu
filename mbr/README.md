# OSDMenu MBR

A custom `__mbr` payload designed for HOSDMenu, HDD-OSD and PSBBN.  
Supports running arbitrary paths from the HDD and memory cards.  

## Installation

1. Edit the [OSDMBR.CNF](../examples/OSDMBR.CNF) as you see fit and copy it to `hdd0:__sysconf/osdmenu/OSDMBR.CNF`
2. Install the payload into the `__mbr` of your HDD using the [OSDMenu MBR Installer](../utils/installer/README.md) or any other way.

## Configuration

The OSDMenu MBR can be configured with the `OSDMBR.CNF` file located at `hdd0:__sysconf/osdmenu/OSDMBR.CNF`.  
See the [OSDMBR.CNF](../examples/OSDMBR.CNF) example configuration file for hints on how to configure the MBR.

### Configuration options

Multiple paths and arguments are supported for every `boot_` key.

1. `boot_auto` — default boot paths
2. `boot_auto_arg` — arguments for the default boot path
3. `boot_start` — paths to run when the Start button is being pressed during boot
4. `boot_start_arg` — arguments for the Start boot path
5. `boot_triangle` — paths to run when the Triangle button is being pressed during boot
6. `boot_triangle_arg` — arguments for the Triangle boot path
7. `boot_circle` — paths to run when the Circle button is being pressed during boot
8. `boot_circle_arg` — arguments for the Circle boot path
9. `boot_cross` — paths to run when the Cross button is being pressed during boot
10. `boot_cross_arg` — arguments for the Cross boot path
11. `boot_square` — paths to run when the Square button is being pressed during boot
12. `boot_square_arg` — arguments for the Square boot path
13. `cdrom_skip_ps2logo` — enables or disables running discs via `rom0:PS2LOGO`
14. `cdrom_disable_gameid` — disables or enables visual Game ID
15. `cdrom_use_dkwdrv` — enables or disables launching DKWDRV for PS1 discs
16. `ps1drv_enable_fast` — will enable fast disc speed for PS1 discs when not using DKWDRV
17. `ps1drv_enable_smooth` — will enable texture smoothing for PS1 discs when not using DKWDRV
18. `ps1drv_use_ps1vn` — will run PS1DRV using the PS1DRV Video Mode Negator
19. `prefer_bbn` — makes the MBR to fallback to PSBBN instead of HOSDMenu/HDD-OSD on errors
20. `app_gameid` — if enabled, the visual Game ID will be displayed for all applications launched by the OSDMenu MBR
21. `osd_screentype` — if set, will set the screen type by changing the flag in MechaCon NVRAM. Valid values are `4:3`, `16:9`, `full`
22. `osd_language` — if set, will set the OSDSYS/HDD-OSD launguage by changing the language flag in MechaCon NVRAM.  
  Valid values:
    - `jap` — Japanese
    - `eng` — English
    - `fre` — French
    - `spa` — Spanish
    - `ger` — German
    - `ita` — Italian
    - `dut` — Dutch
    - `por` — Portugese
    - `rus` — Russian
    - `kor` — Korean
    - `tch` — Traditional Chinese
    - `sch` — Simplified Chinese  

   Note that a list of available languages depends on your PS2 revision and model.  
   For example, Japanese consoles only support Japanese and English languages and will fallback to Japanese if any other language other than English is set.  
   OSDMenu MBR does **not** check whether your console actually supports the language.  

To disable configuration flags just for one boot path while keeping them for other paths, add a `-noflags` as the last argument.

### Supported paths

- `$HOSDSYS` — executes HOSDMenu or HDD-OSD from the following locations:
   - `hdd0:__system/osdmenu/hosdmenu.elf` — HOSDMenu
   - `hdd0:__system/osd100/hosdsys.elf` — HDD-OSD
   - `hdd0:__system/osd100/OSDSYS_A.XLF` — HDD-OSD (alternative path)
- `$PSBBN` — executes PlayStation Broadband Navigator from `hdd0:__system/p2lboot/osdboot.elf`
- `hdd0:<partition name>:PATINFO` — will boot using SYSTEM.CNF from the HDD partition attribute area
- `hdd0:<partition name>:pfs:<path to ELF>` — will boot the ELF from the PFS partition
- `mc?:<PATH>` — executes the ELF from the memory card. Use `?` to make the MBR try both memory cards
- `cdrom` — boots the PS1/PS2 CD/DVD disc
- `dvd` — starts the DVD Player.

### SYSTEM.CNF extensions for partition attribute area (`:PATINFO`) paths

OSDMenu MBR supports additional SYSTEM.CNF arguments for `:PATINFO` paths.  
`SYSTEM.CNF` file from the partition attribute area can contain additional lines:
- `path` — custom ELF path (only `hdd0` and `mc?` paths are supported) 
- `arg` — custom argument to pass to the ELF file. More than one `arg` lines are supported.
- `skip_argv0` — if set to `1`, the target ELF will only receive argv built from `arg` lines (useful for running POPStarter).

### Embedded Neutrino GSM (eGSM)

OSDMenu MBR supports running disc-based PS2 games via the embedded [Neutrino GSM](../utils/egsm/) by automatically loading and applying the per-title options from `hdd0:__sysconf/osdmenu/OSDGSM.CNF`.  
Additionally, it will run the target ELF from the `OSDMBR.CNF` via the [embedded Neutrino GSM](utils/egsm/) when the last argument is `-gsm=<>`.

See the sample configuraton [here](../examples/OSDGSM.CNF) and [this](../utils/loader/README.md#egsm) README for more information on the eGSM argument format.
