# OSDMenu

Patches for OSDSYS and HDD OSD (Browser 2.0) based on Free McBoot 1.8.  

## Usage

### OSDMenu
1. Copy `osdmenu.elf` to `mc?:/BOOT/` or copy and paste `SYS_OSDMENU.psu` via wLaunchELF using `psuPaste`
   Copy DKWDRV to `mc?:/BOOT/DKWDRV.ELF` _(optional)_ 
2. Edit `mc?:/SYS-CONF/OSDMENU.CNF` [as you see fit](patcher/README.md#osdmenucnf)
3. Configure PS2BBL to launch `mc?:/BOOT/osdmenu.elf` or launch it manually from anywhere

### OSDMenu as the System Update

You can install OSDMenu as the System Update instead of FMCB or PS2BBL to get faster boot times.  
The release archive contains the following files:
  - `patcher/kelf/OSDMENU.XLF` — encrypted and signed OSDMenu executable to be installed as `osd???.elf` or `osdmain.elf`
  - `patcher/kelf/osdmenu.icn` — OSDMenu icon for the PS2 Browser
  - `patcher/kelf/icon.sys` — icon manifest for the PS2 Browser

To install OSDMenu as the System Update, you can use the [KELFBinder](https://github.com/israpps/KELFBinder).  
Consult the KELFBinder documentation on how to use the KELFBinder to install your own payloads.

### HOSDMenu — OSDMenu for HDD OSD
1. Install HDD OSD 1.10U  
   Make sure HDD OSD binaries are installed into `hdd0:__system/osd100/` and `hosdsys.elf`/`OSDSYS_A.XLF` is present.  
   SHA-256 hashes of `hosdsys.elf`/`OSDSYS_A.XLF` known to work:
   - `acc905233f79678b9d7c1de99b0aee2409136197d13e7d78bf8978cd85b736ae` — original binary from the official HDD Utility Disc Version 1.10
   - `65360a6c210b36def924770f23d5565382b5fa4519ef0bb8ddf5c556531eec14` — cracked HDD OSD with 48-bit LBA support from the Sony Utility Disc Compilation 4 disc

   When using the unmodified binary on non-NTSC-U consoles, you will have to decrypt and re-encrypt the original binary with [`kelftool`](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/kelftool)
   to change the MagicGate region to 0xff (region free).
2. Copy `hosdmenu.elf` to `hdd0:__system/osdmenu/`  
   Copy DKWDRV to `hdd0:__system/osdmenu/DKWDRV.ELF` _(optional)_ 
3. Edit `hdd0:__sysconf/osdmenu/OSDMENU.CNF` [as you see fit](patcher/README.md#osdmenucnf)
4. Configure your bootloader to launch `hdd0:__system/osdmenu/hosdmenu.elf` or launch it manually from anywhere  

### OSDMenu MBR

You can install OSDMenu MBR into the `__mbr` partition of your HDD for faster HOSDMenu boot times and improved PSBBN support.  
The release archive contains the following files:
  - `osdmbr/OSDMBR.XLF` — encrypted and signed OSDMenu MBR executable to be installed as `__mbr`
  - `osdmbr/osdmbr-installer.elf` — installer that will automatically install the MBR, enable the MBR boot and copy the example configuration file
  - `osdmbr/payloads/` — encrypted binaries for advanced users

See the MBR [README](mbr/README.md) for more details. 

### OSDMenu Launcher

OSDMenu Launcher can be used as a standalone forwarder for launching applications from any supported device.
The release archive contains the following files:
  - `launcher/launcher.elf`--- standalone OSDMenu Launcher 
  - `launcher/OSDMBR.XLF` — encrypted and signed OSDMenu Launcher executable for PATINFO injection

See the launcher [README](launcher/README.md) for more details. 

## Key differences from FMCB 1.8:
- All OSD initialization code is removed
- USB support is dropped from the patcher, so only memory cards are checked for `OSDMENU.CNF`
- No ESR support
- No support for launching ELFs by holding a gamepad button
- ELF paths are not checked by the patcher, so every named entry from FMCB config file is displayed in hacked OSDSYS menu
- Support for launching applications from MMCE, MX4SIO, UDPBD, iLink devices and APA- and exFAT-formatted HDDs
- CD/DVD support was extended to support skipping PS2LOGO, mounting VMCs on MMCE devices, showing visual GameID for PixelFX devices and booting DKWDRV for PS1 discs
- Integrated Neutrino GSM for disc games and applications
- "Unlimited" number of paths for each entry
- Support for 1080i and 480p (as line-doubled 240p) video modes
- Support for "protokernel" systems (SCPH-10000, SCPH-15000) ported from Free McBoot 1.9 by reverse-engineering
- Support for launching applications from the memory card browser
- Support for setting PS1 driver options on every boot
- Support for HDD OSD 1.10U

## Configuration
